# Module 4: Multi-File Project Management
### Microsoft C++ Programming Professional Certificate

## 📂 Project Overview
This project marks a transition from single-file scripting to **modular software engineering**. The goal was to build a comprehensive Math Utility Library by separating function declarations, implementations, and the main execution logic across multiple files. This structure mirrors industry-standard practices for scalability and maintainability.

  ✨ Features
Interactive Menu: A do-while loop combined with a switch statement allows users to navigate the library without restarting the program.

Dynamic User Input: Replaced hard-coded test values with std::cin to allow real-time calculations.

Input Validation: Logic to handle invalid menu selections and prevent infinite loops on bad input.

Color-Coded UI: Utilized ANSI escape codes via a dedicated constants header to provide visual feedback.

🧠 Practice Challenges & Insights
Challenge 1: Header Guards
Question: What is the purpose of the #ifndef, #define, and #endif directives? Why are they important in header files? Answer: These are Include Guards. They prevent Redefinition Errors. Without them, if a header is included multiple times, the compiler tries to define the same functions twice, causing the build to fail.

Challenge 2: Compilation & Linking
Question: How does the compilation process change for multi-file projects? Write a single compilation command and research useful compiler flags. Answer: We move to a two-step Compile and Link process. Each .cpp is compiled to an object file (.o), then the Linker joins them. Command: g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 main.cpp basic_math.cpp advanced_math.cpp geometry.cpp -o math_program

-Wall: Shows all common warnings.

-O2: Optimizes for speed.

🚀 How to Run
Build: g++ main.cpp basic_math.cpp advanced_math.cpp geometry.cpp -o math_program

Execute: ./math_program (Linux/Mac) or math_program (Windows)

📝 Personal Reflection
This lab was a pivotal moment in my transition from a "coder" to a "developer." I learned:

The Contract vs. The Implementation: A header is a promise; the source file is the fulfillment.

The Power of the Linker: The linker is the architect that connects various object files.

User-Centric Design: Moving to an interactive menu taught me the importance of input validation.

### **Advanced Input Validation**
* **Stream State Checking:** Implemented `!(cin >> var)` logic to monitor the health of the standard input stream. 
* **Buffer Management:** Utilized `cin.clear()` and `cin.ignore()` to resolve "Fail Bits" and flush the input buffer, preventing infinite loops during invalid data entry.
