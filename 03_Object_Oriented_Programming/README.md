# Module 03: Object-Oriented Programming (C++)
**Status:** 🟢 Module 1 Complete | 🟡 Transitioning to Module 2
**Focus:** Class Architecture, Modular Design, and Resource Safety (RAII)
**Goal:** Transition from procedural scripting to high-tier "Architectural" engineering.

## 🏛️ Module 1: Classes & Objects (Finalized)
This module established the blueprint for industrial-grade, modular software.

| Milestone | Technical Objective | Industrial Context (FieldLogic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class Definition** | Created complex data members and logic blocks. | Designing the blueprint for a Veeder-Root Mag Probe. |
| **Lifecycle Mgmt** | Implemented RAII via Constructors & Destructors. | Managing how a sensor initializes and shuts down. |
| **Encapsulation** | Enforced security via private/public access control. | Protecting calibration data from accidental overwrites. |
| **Modularization** | Split logic into `.h` and `.cpp` with CMake build logs. | Organizing code for site-wide ATG network deployments. |

## 🚀 Advanced Roadmap
The "1:10" pivot continues as we move into memory-specific logic:
* **Module 2 (Inheritance/Polymorphism):** Extending base hardware classes to create specialized devices (e.g., specific sensor models).
* **Module 3 (Memory Management):** Mastering the "Hexadecimal Frontier"—pointers and smart pointers to handle resources with zero waste.
* **Module 4 (Robustness):** Fail-safe error handling for mission-critical industrial stability.

## 🛠️ Integrated Lab Strategies
* **Architectural Persistence:** Using Git commits to prevent data loss during directory re-structuring.
* **Modular Logic:** Maintaining the separation of "Interface" and "Implementation."
* **Build Automation:** Leveraging CMake for deterministic compilation across environments.
