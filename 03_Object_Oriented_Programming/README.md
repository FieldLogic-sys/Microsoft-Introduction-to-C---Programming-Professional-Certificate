# Module 03: Object-Oriented Programming (C++)
**Status:** 🟡 Active Development
**Focus:** Class Architecture, Encapsulation, and Object Lifecycle Management
**Goal:** Transition from procedural scripting to structured "Architectural" programming.

## 🏛️ Module 1: Classes & Objects (Current Focus)
This module establishes the core blueprint for industrial-grade software.

| Milestone | Technical Objective | Industrial Context (FieldLogic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Class Definition** | Create data members and member functions. | Designing the blueprint for a Veeder-Root Mag Probe. |
| **Lifecycle Mgmt** | Implement Constructors & Destructors. | Managing how a sensor initializes and shuts down. |
| **Encapsulation** | Enforce security via Access Modifiers. | Protecting calibration data from accidental overwrites. |
| **Instantiation** | Effectively create and use Object instances. | Running multiple tank monitors on a single controller. |

## 🚀 Advanced Roadmap
Looking ahead, the syllabus outlines the shift toward "1:10" efficiency:
* **Module 2 (Inheritance/Polymorphism):** Extending base hardware classes to create specialized devices (e.g., specific sensor models).
* **Module 3 (Memory Management):** Master pointers and smart pointers to handle resources with zero waste—the mark of an elite engineer.
* **Module 4 (Robustness):** Implementing error-handling to prevent the "breaking stuff" anxiety by making code "fail-safe".

## 🛠️ Integrated Lab Strategies
I will leverage the following syllabus resources to maximize my 90-day pivot:
* **Coach Dialogues:** Relating theoretical code to my hardware field experience.
* **Screencasts:** Visualizing step-by-step memory allocation.
* **GenAI Tools:** Using professional AI integration to ensure code reliability and testing rigor.
